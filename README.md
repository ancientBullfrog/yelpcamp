This is the end of course project created in The Web Development Bootcamp by Colt Steele. It is a resource for campsites where users can upload and review the sites they have been to.

The following aspects were covered:
- CRUD operations for campsite management
- REST route logic
- Authentication & Authorisation
- Serverside data validation with Joi
- Malicious code injection, countered in part by a Joi plugin to strip out HTML, Helmet and Mongo-Sanitize
- Adding reviews to individual campgrounds.
- Image storage and manipulation with Cloudinary
- Displaying a location with Mapbox
